  ## Goals

  I wanted to create a web application that allows a user to track income and expenses, I wanted to make it functional both on and off line.

  ## Motivation

  Proper budget tracking can lead to increased financial security and comfort, this application allows for users to focus more on what they want to do instead of worrying about their current financial status.

  ## Usage

  This application can be used both online and offline to assist in tracking financial transactions.

  ## Installation
  
  >`npm i`     
  
  followed by   
  
  >`node server.js`  

  ## Test

  ## Problems

  Getting the offline functionality working proved to be difficult but I'm glad that I was able to work through the issues.
